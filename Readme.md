- **Educational Insights**: Gain insights into game theory concepts and the dynamics of strategic interactions.

## How to Play
1. **Installation**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
3. **Execution**: Run the `prisoners_dilemma.py` script to start the simulation.
4. **Strategy Selection**: Choose your decision strategy and witness its impact on the outcome.
5. **Analysis**: Explore numerical data and graphical representations to understand the implications of different strategies.
6. **Iterate and Learn**: Experiment with different strategies, tweak parameters, and refine your understanding of strategic decision-making.

## Decision Strategies

### Tit-for-Tat (TFT)
- **Strategy**: Start with cooperation and then mirror the opponent's previous move.
- **Description**: Forgiving but firm, as it retaliates against defection but forgives and returns to cooperation if the opponent cooperates again.

### Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS)
- **Strategy**: Start with cooperation. Continue cooperating as long as you win or draw; switch to defection if you lose.
- **Description**: Reactive and adaptive, adjusting based on the outcome of previous interactions.

### Pavlov (or "Win-Stay, Lose-Switch")
- **Strategy**: Start with cooperation. Keep the same action if it resulted in the highest payoff in the previous round; switch actions otherwise.
- **Description**: Reinforces successful strategies while abandoning unsuccessful ones, promoting stability.

### Random
- **Strategy**: Choose cooperation or defection randomly, with equal probability, in each round.
- **Description**: Introduces unpredictability into the game, sometimes exploiting overly deterministic opponents.

### Grim Trigger
- **Strategy**: Start with cooperation and continue cooperating unless the opponent defects; switch to defection permanently if the opponent defects.
- **Description**: Punishes defection severely, promoting long-term cooperation.

### Tit-for-Two-Tats (TFTT)
- **Strategy**: Cooperate unless the opponent defects twice in a row.
- **Description**: More forgiving than TFT, allowing for occasional mistakes by the opponent without triggering retaliation.

### Soft Tit-for-Tat
- **Strategy**: Mimic the opponent's previous move, but with a small probability of error.
- **Description**: Introduces noise into the decision-making process, making it less predictable.

### Forgiving Tit-for-Tat
- **Strategy**: Occasionally forgive the opponent's defection without immediate cooperation in return.
- **Description**: Similar to TFT but with occasional unconditional cooperation, promoting flexibility.

### Reverse Tit-for-Tat
- **Strategy**: Start with defection and then mimic the opponent's previous move.
- **Description**: Opposite of TFT, adjusting based on the opponent's previous move.

### Cooperator
- **Strategy**: Always cooperate regardless of the opponent's move.
- **Description**: Maintains cooperation and can exploit opponents who defect in the long run.

### Defector
- **Strategy**: Always defect regardless of the opponent's move.
- **Description**: Maximizes personal payoff but often leads to mutual defection and lower overall payoffs in repeated interactions.

### Tester
- **Strategy**: Defects to check how opponent reacts and tries taking advantage of them.
- **Description**: Tests opponents based on reaction.


## Future Improvements
- **Advanced AI Models**: Develop sophisticated AI algorithms to simulate human-like decision-making.
- **Multiplayer Integration**: Enable multiplayer functionality for interactive gameplay with friends or online opponents.
- **Enhanced Visualization**: Implement stunning graphical enhancements for a more engaging user experience.
- **Statistical Insights**: Integrate comprehensive statistical analysis tools to dissect gameplay patterns and outcomes.
