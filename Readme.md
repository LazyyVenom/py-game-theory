# Py-Game Implementation of Prisoner's Dilemma üêçüéÆ

![Prisoner's Dilemma](prisoners_dilemma.png)

## Introduction
This project implements the classic game theory scenario, **Prisoner's Dilemma**, using Python and Pygame. In this game, two players must decide whether to cooperate or defect, with the aim of maximizing their own payoff while considering the other player's decision.

## Features
- **Pygame Interface**: Engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma in a visually appealing environment created using Pygame.
- **Decision Strategies**: Implement various decision-making strategies for players, such as tit-for-tat, random, forgiving, and more.
- **Scoring System**: Track and display scores based on the outcomes of each round, including mutual cooperation, mutual defection, and mixed outcomes.

## How to Play
1. **Installation**: Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. **Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system.
3. **Execution**: Run the `prisoners_dilemma.py` script to start the game.
4. **Gameplay**: Make decisions to cooperate or defect in each round, aiming to maximize your score while considering your opponent's actions.

## Decision Strategies
Several decision-making strategies can be implemented for the players:
- **Tit-for-Tat**: Cooperate on the first move, then mirror the opponent's previous move.
- **Random**: Make decisions randomly, without considering the opponent's actions.
- **Forgiving**: Start with cooperation, but forgive occasional defections.
- **Always Cooperate**: Always choose to cooperate regardless of the opponent's actions.
- **Always Defect**: Always choose to defect regardless of the opponent's actions.
- *Feel free to implement your own strategies!*

## Future Improvements
- **Enhanced AI**: Develop more sophisticated decision-making algorithms for AI opponents.
- **Multiplayer Support**: Enable multiplayer functionality to compete against friends or online opponents.
- **Graphical Enhancements**: Improve the visual aspects of the game interface for a more immersive experience.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Add features to analyze and visualize the outcomes of multiple game sessions.
