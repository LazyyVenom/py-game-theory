1. **Tit-for-Tat (TFT)**:
   - Strategy: Start with cooperation and then mirror the opponent's previous move.
   - Description: Forgiving but firm, as it retaliates against defection but forgives and returns to cooperation if the opponent cooperates again.

2. **Win-Stay, Lose-Shift (WSLS)**:
   - Strategy: Start with cooperation. Continue cooperating as long as you win or draw; switch to defection if you lose.
   - Description: Reactive and adaptive, adjusting based on the outcome of previous interactions.

3. **Pavlov** (or "Win-Stay, Lose-Switch"):
   - Strategy: Start with cooperation. Keep the same action if it resulted in the highest payoff in the previous round; switch actions otherwise.
   - Description: Reinforces successful strategies while abandoning unsuccessful ones, promoting stability.

4. **Random**:
   - Strategy: Choose cooperation or defection randomly, with equal probability, in each round.
   - Description: Introduces unpredictability into the game, sometimes exploiting overly deterministic opponents.

5. **Grim Trigger**:
   - Strategy: Start with cooperation and continue cooperating unless the opponent defects; switch to defection permanently if the opponent defects.
   - Description: Punishes defection severely, promoting long-term cooperation.

6. **Tit-for-Two-Tats (TFTT)**:
   - Strategy: Cooperate unless the opponent defects twice in a row.
   - Description: More forgiving than TFT, allowing for occasional mistakes by the opponent without triggering retaliation.

7. **Soft Tit-for-Tat**:
   - Strategy: Mimic the opponent's previous move, but with a small probability of error.
   - Description: Introduces noise into the decision-making process, making it less predictable.

8. **Forgiving Tit-for-Tat**:
   - Strategy: Occasionally forgive the opponent's defection without immediate cooperation in return.
   - Description: Similar to TFT but with occasional unconditional cooperation, promoting flexibility.

9. **Reverse Tit-for-Tat**:
   - Strategy: Start with defection and then mimic the opponent's previous move.
   - Description: Opposite of TFT, adjusting based on the opponent's previous move.

10. **Pavlov-DS** (Deterministic Selection):
    - Strategy: Similar to Pavlov, but with a deterministic strategy selection based on the highest payoff in the previous round.
    - Description: Reinforces successful strategies deterministically, promoting stability.

11. **Cooperator**:
    - Strategy: Always cooperate regardless of the opponent's move.
    - Description: Maintains cooperation and can exploit opponents who defect in the long run.

12. **Defector**:
    - Strategy: Always defect regardless of the opponent's move.
    - Description: Maximizes personal payoff but often leads to mutual defection and lower overall payoffs in repeated interactions.
